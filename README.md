the style of the resume to your own liking.


 cvpic_square.jpg

The pixel size of the file is irrelevant.

The font sizes for downloading as .pdf can only be
changed in this file.


 headline.html

Change the plain text in this file to your
own name, one-liner, etc.


 bckgrnd_pattern_XX

These files are placeholders. Feel free to use them
or change them to your own design. They are used
to add flavour to the bullet point section
of the resume, beneath the coloured containers.

You can remove background graphics entirely:
- Open "cv_customization.css".
- Locate the class tag ".short-inf-background-image".
- Remove the "background-image" property.
